## Rationale

### Why This Change Was Made

1. **Industry Standard Compliance**
   - 30ml (1 oz) is the globally recognized standard serving size for spirits
   - Ensures compliance with responsible alcohol service guidelines

2. **Menu Consistency**
   - All other spirit categories already use 30ml:
     - Premium & Scotch Whisky (20 items) - 30ml ✓
     - Single Malt Whisky (18 items) - 30ml ✓
     - Tequila (3 items) - 30ml ✓
     - Gin (8 items) - 30ml ✓
     - Rum (5 items) - 30ml ✓
     - Brandy (2 items) - 30ml ✓
     - Liqueurs (9 items) - 30ml ✓

3. **Portion Control**
   - Standardized serving size improves inventory management
   - Better cost control and pricing consistency
   - Reduces confusion for bartenders and customers

4. **Customer Clarity**
   - Uniform serving sizes make it easier for customers to understand portions
   - Facilitates comparison between different spirit categories
