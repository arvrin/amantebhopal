## Two Implementation Paths

### Path A: Simple & Fast (2 weeks) ⚡ RECOMMENDED
**Best for:** Quick launch, minimal complexity

- Food, Bar, Café menu pages
- Search and filter functionality
- Mobile-optimized design
- Professional QR codes

**Limitations:**

### Path B: Full Featured (3-4 weeks) 🚀
**Best for:** Long-term scalability
**Cost:** ~₹50,000-100,000 + ₹500-2,000/month
**Tech:** Database + Admin Panel

**What you get:**
- Everything from Path A, plus:
- Real-time menu updates
- Admin panel for staff

**Week 4-6:** Upgrade to Path B if needed

**Why this works:**
- Get to market faster
- Test with real customers
- Validate before investing more
