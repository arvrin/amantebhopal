## NOTES FOR IMPLEMENTATION

### Critical Points
1. **Mobile First:** Build mobile layouts first, enhance for desktop
2. **Accessibility:** Not optional, build it in from the start
3. **Performance:** Lazy load images, optimize everything
4. **Consistency:** Use design tokens, don't hardcode values
5. **User Testing:** Test forms with real users before launch

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid
- ❌ Hardcoding colors instead of using CSS variables
- ❌ Building desktop first, trying to adapt to mobile
- ❌ Forgetting hover states have no meaning on touch devices
- ❌ Using insufficient color contrast
- ❌ Making touch targets too small
- ❌ Forgetting focus states for keyboard navigation
- ❌ Using generic error messages ("Error" instead of "Email is required")
- ❌ Not showing loading states during async operations

### Best Practices
- ✅ Use semantic HTML (header, nav, main, footer, article, section)
- ✅ Test on real mobile devices, not just emulators
- ✅ Use Next.js Image component for all images
- ✅ Implement proper meta tags for SEO
- ✅ Add proper alt text to all images
- ✅ Test with keyboard-only navigation
- ✅ Run Lighthouse audits regularly
- ✅ Use TypeScript for type safety
