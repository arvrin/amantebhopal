## Critical Issues
**Issues that break user experience or prevent task completion**

### 1. Missing Breadcrumbs Across All Pages
**Location:** All page templates
**Problem:** Users cannot understand their location within the site hierarchy or navigate back easily. No breadcrumb navigation exists on any page.
**User Impact:** Users become disoriented, especially when navigating between the six space pages or form pages. Increases back button usage and potential abandonment.
**Recommended Fix:**
- Add breadcrumb component to all pages except homepage
- Pattern: Home > Our Spaces > CafÃ© & Bakery
- Make breadcrumbs clickable for quick navigation
- Add schema.org BreadcrumbList structured data

### 2. Header Dropdown Not Keyboard Accessible
**Location:** `/src/components/layout/Header.tsx` (lines 72-95)
**Problem:** The "Our Spaces" dropdown menu only opens on hover, making it completely inaccessible via keyboard navigation. Violates WCAG 2.1 Level A (2.1.1 Keyboard).
**User Impact:** Keyboard-only users and screen reader users cannot access any of the six space pages through main navigation.
**Recommended Fix:**
```typescript
// Add keyboard event handlers
onKeyDown={(e) => {
  if (e.key === 'Enter' || e.key === ' ') {
    setIsSpacesOpen(!isSpacesOpen);
  }
  if (e.key === 'Escape') {
    setIsSpacesOpen(false);
  }
}}
// Add proper ARIA attributes
aria-expanded={isSpacesOpen}
aria-haspopup="true"
```

### 3. Select Component Missing Options Prop Implementation
**Location:** `/src/components/ui/Select.tsx` (line 15)
**Problem:** Select component defines `options` prop in interface but all forms pass inline `<option>` children instead, creating API inconsistency.
**User Impact:** Developers experience confusion, potential bugs when switching between patterns. Inconsistent form implementation.
**Recommended Fix:**
- Either remove `options` prop from interface and make it children-based
- OR implement options-based rendering and update all forms
- Document the chosen pattern clearly

### 4. Form Validation Errors Not Announced to Screen Readers
**Location:** All form pages (reservations, contact, feedback, careers, etc.)
**Problem:** Form validation errors lack `aria-live` regions, so screen reader users don't know submission failed or what fields have errors.
**User Impact:** Screen reader users cannot complete forms successfully. Violates WCAG 2.1 Level A (4.1.3 Status Messages).
**Recommended Fix:**
```typescript
// Add to form submission error handling
<div
  role="alert"
  aria-live="assertive"
  className="sr-only"
>
  {validationErrors.length > 0 &&
    `Form has ${validationErrors.length} errors. Please correct and try again.`
  }
</div>
```

### 5. Missing Skip Navigation Link
**Location:** `/src/components/layout/Header.tsx`
**Problem:** No "Skip to main content" link for keyboard users to bypass repetitive navigation.
**User Impact:** Keyboard and screen reader users must tab through entire header navigation on every page. Violates WCAG 2.1 Level A (2.4.1 Bypass Blocks).
**Recommended Fix:**
```typescript
<a
  href="#main-content"
  className="sr-only focus:not-sr-only focus:absolute focus:top-4 focus:left-4 focus:z-50 focus:px-4 focus:py-2 focus:bg-amante-red focus:text-white"
>
  Skip to main content
</a>
// Add id="main-content" to main content wrapper
```

### 6. File Upload Component Missing Error Handling UI
**Location:** `/src/components/ui/FileUpload.tsx`
**Problem:** File upload component (used in careers page) doesn't display error messages when file size exceeds limit or format is incorrect.
**User Impact:** Users don't know why their resume upload failed, leading to form abandonment.
**Recommended Fix:**
- Add error state display in FileUpload component
- Show specific error messages (file too large, wrong format)
- Add visual error indication (red border, error icon)

### 7. No Loading States for Image-Heavy Gallery Page
**Location:** `/src/app/gallery/page.tsx`
**Problem:** Gallery page has 33 placeholder items but no skeleton loading states or progressive loading. Page appears broken while loading.
**User Impact:** Users see blank page or broken layout on slow connections, assume site is broken, abandon.
**Recommended Fix:**
- Add skeleton loaders for gallery grid
- Implement lazy loading for images
- Show loading spinner during initial render

### 8. Mobile Menu Covers Content Without Scroll Lock
**Location:** `/src/components/layout/Header.tsx` (lines 143-230)
**Problem:** When mobile menu is open, users can still scroll background content, creating confusion and accidental dismissals.
**User Impact:** Poor mobile UX, users accidentally close menu, difficult to navigate on mobile.
**Recommended Fix:**
```typescript
useEffect(() => {
  if (isMobileMenuOpen) {
    document.body.style.overflow = 'hidden';
  } else {
    document.body.style.overflow = 'unset';
  }
  return () => {
    document.body.style.overflow = 'unset';
  };
}, [isMobileMenuOpen]);
```

### 9. Success Pages Missing Back Navigation
**Location:** All success states (reservations, contact, feedback, careers, private-events)
**Problem:** After successful form submission, users can only "Return Home" or resubmit. No way to navigate to related pages or continue browsing.
**User Impact:** Users feel trapped, forced to start navigation over from homepage.
**Recommended Fix:**
- Add "Browse Our Spaces" button
- Add "View Menu" button
- Add "Explore Events" button
- Provide contextual next steps based on form type

### 10. Phone Number Pattern Validation Too Restrictive
**Location:** All forms with phone input (pattern="[+]?[0-9]{10,15}")
**Problem:** Pattern doesn't allow common formats like (123) 456-7890 or 123-456-7890, frustrating users.
**User Impact:** Users' valid phone numbers are rejected, form abandonment increases.
**Recommended Fix:**
- Use more flexible regex: `pattern="^[\+]?[(]?[0-9]{3}[)]?[-\s\.]?[0-9]{3}[-\s\.]?[0-9]{4,6}$"`
- OR remove pattern and do server-side validation
- Show example format: "e.g., +91 98937 79100"

### 11. Footer Privacy/Terms Links Go Nowhere
**Location:** `/src/components/layout/Footer.tsx` (lines 200-208)
**Problem:** Footer links to Privacy Policy, Terms of Service, and Cancellation Policy pages that don't exist, resulting in 404 errors.
**User Impact:** Users trying to review policies hit dead ends, loss of trust, potential legal compliance issues.
**Recommended Fix:**
- Create actual policy pages OR
- Remove links until pages are ready OR
- Link to coming-soon placeholders

### 12. Gallery Lightbox Not Keyboard Escapable
**Location:** `/src/app/gallery/page.tsx` (lines 296-372)
**Problem:** Lightbox modal can only be closed by clicking close button or backdrop, not by Escape key.
**User Impact:** Keyboard users cannot close lightbox, trapped in modal. Violates WCAG 2.1 Level A (2.1.2 No Keyboard Trap).
**Recommended Fix:**
```typescript
useEffect(() => {
  const handleEscape = (e: KeyboardEvent) => {
    if (e.key === 'Escape' && selectedImage) {
      setSelectedImage(null);
    }
  };
  document.addEventListener('keydown', handleEscape);
  return () => document.removeEventListener('keydown', handleEscape);
}, [selectedImage]);
```

### 13. Missing Focus Management on Modal Open
**Location:** All pages with modals/success states
**Problem:** When modals or success states appear, focus doesn't move to the new content, screen readers don't announce the change.
**User Impact:** Screen reader users don't know modal opened, keyboard users' focus remains on background.
**Recommended Fix:**
```typescript
const modalRef = useRef<HTMLDivElement>(null);
useEffect(() => {
  if (isSuccess && modalRef.current) {
    modalRef.current.focus();
  }
}, [isSuccess]);
// Add tabIndex={-1} and ref to modal container
```

---

## Major Issues
**Issues that significantly impact UX but don't completely block tasks**

### 14. Inconsistent CTA Button Placement
**Location:** All pages with CTAs
**Problem:** Primary CTAs sometimes use `<Link>` wrapper, sometimes `<a>` tags, sometimes buttons with onClick. Inconsistent patterns across pages.
**User Impact:** Inconsistent behavior (some open in new tab with cmd+click, others don't), maintenance difficulties.
**Recommended Fix:** Standardize on Next.js `<Link>` for internal navigation, ensure all CTAs support browser navigation features.

### 15. Space Pages Use Identical Layout Without Differentiation
**Location:** `/src/components/SpacePageTemplate.tsx` and all space page implementations
**Problem:** All six space pages use exact same template with same structure, colors, and animations. No visual differentiation between spaces.
**User Impact:** Users confused about which space they're viewing, spaces don't feel unique, brand storytelling weakened.
**Recommended Fix:**
- Add unique color themes per space (cafe: browns/ambers, lounge: deep purples, club: vibrant neons)
- Add space-specific imagery (currently all placeholders)
- Vary layout slightly per space type

### 16. Form Field Labels Not Associated with Inputs
**Location:** Multiple form pages where labels are separate from Input component
**Problem:** Labels rendered outside Input component don't have programmatic association via `htmlFor` and `id`.
**User Impact:** Screen reader users can't determine which label goes with which field. Violates WCAG 2.1 Level A (1.3.1 Info and Relationships).
**Recommended Fix:**
- Pass label prop to Input component to ensure proper association
- OR add explicit id/htmlFor associations manually

### 17. No Autofocus on Form Page Load
**Location:** All form pages
**Problem:** Users must manually click into first field, adding unnecessary interaction step.
**User Impact:** Slows form completion, especially on desktop. Not critical but reduces efficiency.
**Recommended Fix:**
```typescript
const firstFieldRef = useRef<HTMLInputElement>(null);
useEffect(() => {
  firstFieldRef.current?.focus();
}, []);
// Add ref to first input
```

### 18. Character Count Shows After Typing (Not Before)
**Location:** Reservations, Contact, Careers, Private Events forms
**Problem:** Character counters display "0/500 characters" only after user types, not immediately visible as guidance.
**User Impact:** Users don't know field has character limit until they start typing.
**Recommended Fix:** Make counter visible immediately, use muted color until user starts typing.

### 19. Star Rating Not Navigable by Keyboard
**Location:** `/src/app/feedback/page.tsx` (lines 106-143)
**Problem:** Star rating buttons don't support keyboard navigation (arrow keys to change rating, Enter to select).
**User Impact:** Keyboard users must tab through all 5 stars individually, slow and cumbersome.
**Recommended Fix:** Implement arrow key navigation within rating group, add role="radiogroup" with proper ARIA attributes.

### 20. Success State Removes All Context
**Location:** All form success pages
**Problem:** Success state replaces entire form with success message, user can't review what they submitted.
**User Impact:** Users unsure if they filled everything correctly, no confirmation of details, increased support requests.
**Recommended Fix:** Show summary of submitted information in success state (name, date, party size, etc.).

### 21. No Indication of Required vs Optional Fields
**Location:** All forms
**Problem:** Required fields marked with asterisk (*) but no legend explaining what asterisk means. Optional fields not clearly marked.
**User Impact:** Users uncertain which fields are mandatory, may skip required fields.
**Recommended Fix:**
- Add form legend: "* indicates required field"
- Consider marking optional fields with "(optional)" instead
- Make optional fields visually distinct (lighter label color)

### 22. Events Filter Buttons Too Small on Mobile
**Location:** `/src/app/events/page.tsx` (lines 186-220)
**Problem:** Filter buttons with icons + text become cramped on mobile, difficult to tap accurately.
**User Impact:** Users struggle to tap correct filter, especially on smaller phones. Violates WCAG 2.1 Level AAA (2.5.5 Target Size).
**Recommended Fix:** Stack filters vertically on mobile OR hide text and show icons only OR use dropdown select on mobile.

### 23. Gallery Sticky Filter Jumps on Scroll
**Location:** `/src/app/gallery/page.tsx` (line 155)
**Problem:** Sticky filter bar at top causes content jump when scrolling due to z-index and backdrop-blur without proper height compensation.
**User Impact:** Jarring scroll experience, users lose place when scrolling.
**Recommended Fix:** Add proper height placeholder when filter becomes sticky, smooth transition.

### 24. No Empty State Guidance
**Location:** Events and Gallery filter results
**Problem:** When filters return no results, empty state only shows "No events found. Check back soon!" without guidance on what to do.
**User Impact:** Users unsure if it's a bug or if there really are no results, no path forward.
**Recommended Fix:**
- Add "Try a different filter" suggestion
- Show related content that IS available
- Add "Request this type of event" action

### 25. Time Slot Selection Too Limited
**Location:** `/src/app/reservations/page.tsx` (lines 28-35)
**Problem:** Only 6 pre-defined time slots (11 AM, 1 PM, 3 PM, 7 PM, 9 PM, 11 PM). No flexibility for off-times.
**User Impact:** Users wanting 6:30 PM or 8 PM have to choose closest time, may conflict with their schedule.
**Recommended Fix:**
- Add more granular time slots (every 30 minutes)
- OR add "Other (specify in special requests)" option
- OR use time input field with validation

### 26. Footer "Get in Touch" Hours Don't Match Header
**Location:** Footer shows "11 AM - 12 AM" but Contact page shows different hours
**Problem:** Inconsistent information across pages creates confusion about actual operating hours.
**User Impact:** Users don't know real hours, may arrive when closed.
**Recommended Fix:** Centralize hours information in config file, use single source of truth across all pages.

### 27. Private Events Form Missing Date Flexibility
**Location:** `/src/app/private-events/page.tsx`
**Problem:** Event date is required field with single date picker. Events often need date ranges or flexible dates.
**User Impact:** Users with flexible dates forced to pick arbitrary date, may need to change later.
**Recommended Fix:** Add "Date is flexible" checkbox, show date range picker option.

### 28. Mobile Menu Doesn't Show Active Page
**Location:** `/src/components/layout/Header.tsx` mobile menu
**Problem:** Mobile menu highlights active page in navigation list but not in dropdown submenu items.
**User Impact:** Users don't know which space page they're currently viewing when opening mobile menu.
**Recommended Fix:** Apply active state styling to dropdown items in mobile menu matching pathname.

### 29. Button Loading State Only Shows Text Change
**Location:** `/src/components/ui/Button.tsx`
**Problem:** Loading state shows spinner and changes text but button remains fully enabled appearance, not clearly disabled.
**User Impact:** Users might try to click multiple times, unsure if first click registered.
**Recommended Fix:** Add visual disabled state when loading (reduced opacity, cursor: not-allowed).

### 30. Homepage Hero Height Issues on Short Screens
**Location:** `/src/components/HomePage.tsx` (line 121) - `h-screen`
**Problem:** Hero section at 100vh height pushes content below fold on short screens (laptops with browser chrome).
**User Impact:** Users on laptops/short screens don't see scroll indicator, think page is complete.
**Recommended Fix:** Use `min-h-[600px] h-screen max-h-[900px]` to ensure reasonable bounds.

### 31. About Page Placeholder Images Confusing
**Location:** `/src/app/about/page.tsx` - gradient placeholder boxes with icons
**Problem:** Obvious placeholder gradients with icons make site look unfinished, unprofessional.
**User Impact:** Users question site legitimacy, reduced trust in brand.
**Recommended Fix:** Replace with actual photos OR use higher-quality stock photos OR remove image sections until real photos available.

### 32. Contact Page Inquiry Types Too Vague
**Location:** `/src/app/contact/page.tsx` (line 23)
**Problem:** Inquiry types include "General", "Issue", "Feedback" which overlap and confuse users on which to choose.
**User Impact:** Inquiries routed incorrectly, slower response times.
**Recommended Fix:**
- Rename to clearer categories: "General Information", "Report a Problem", "Share Feedback"
- Add description helper text for each option
- Route to specific teams based on selection

### 33. Gallery Share Functionality Incomplete
**Location:** `/src/app/gallery/page.tsx` (lines 95-106)
**Problem:** Share button shows "alert('Share functionality would be implemented here')" - debug code left in production.
**User Impact:** Users think feature is broken, poor professional impression.
**Recommended Fix:** Either implement proper share functionality OR remove share buttons until ready.

### 34. Events Page Date Formatting Overly Verbose
**Location:** `/src/app/events/page.tsx` (lines 280-285)
**Problem:** Dates shown as "Saturday, October 30, 2025" takes excessive space, especially on mobile cards.
**User Impact:** Event cards become cramped, harder to scan multiple events quickly.
**Recommended Fix:** Use shorter format: "Sat, Oct 30, 2025" OR "Oct 30 â¢ Saturday"

### 35. Careers Form Expected Salary Optional But Should Guide
**Location:** `/src/app/careers/page.tsx` (lines 377-391)
**Problem:** Salary field is optional with no guidance, makes budgeting difficult for HR, users uncertain if they should fill it.
**User Impact:** Mismatched salary expectations discovered late in process, wasted time.
**Recommended Fix:**
- Add helper text: "Helps us ensure mutual fit"
- Consider making it range instead of exact number
- Add "Negotiable" checkbox option

### 36. No Confirmation Before Leaving Filled Forms
**Location:** All form pages
**Problem:** If user fills form partially and navigates away, no warning, all data lost.
**User Impact:** Accidental form abandonment, frustration, users must re-enter all data.
**Recommended Fix:**
```typescript
useEffect(() => {
  const handleBeforeUnload = (e: BeforeUnloadEvent) => {
    if (formHasChanges && !isSuccess) {
      e.preventDefault();
      e.returnValue = '';
    }
  };
  window.addEventListener('beforeunload', handleBeforeUnload);
  return () => window.removeEventListener('beforeunload', handleBeforeUnload);
}, [formHasChanges, isSuccess]);
```

### 37. Footer Social Media Links Not Verified
**Location:** `/src/components/layout/Footer.tsx` (lines 140-167)
**Problem:** Social media links point to amantebhopal handles but likely don't exist yet (placeholder URLs).
**User Impact:** Users click links and find non-existent pages, brand credibility damaged.
**Recommended Fix:** Verify accounts exist OR add "Coming Soon" indicator OR remove until accounts are active.

---

## Minor Issues
**Polish issues and smaller improvements**

### 38. Scroll Indicator Arrow Animation Not Smooth
**Location:** All pages with `animate-bounce` (HomePage, SpacePages, etc.)
**Problem:** Bounce animation feels too aggressive, draws excessive attention.
**User Impact:** Minor visual annoyance, distracts from main content.
**Recommended Fix:** Use gentler animation:
```css
animate-[bounce_3s_ease-in-out_infinite]
```

### 39. Button Hover Transform Not Accessible
**Location:** `/src/components/ui/Button.tsx` primary variant (line 30)
**Problem:** `-translate-y-0.5` hover effect is purely decorative and causes layout shift.
**User Impact:** Minor visual jank, can affect users sensitive to motion.
**Recommended Fix:** Add `will-change: transform` OR use scale instead of translate.

### 40. Inconsistent Spacing Units
**Location:** Throughout all components
**Problem:** Mixing `gap-4`, `gap-6`, `gap-8`, `mb-6`, `mb-8`, `mb-12` without clear system.
**User Impact:** Visual inconsistency, maintenance difficulty.
**Recommended Fix:** Define spacing scale in design system: small (gap-4), medium (gap-6), large (gap-8), xl (gap-12).

### 41. Color Contrast Issues with Grey Text
**Location:** Helper text throughout forms using `text-amante-grey`
**Problem:** May not meet WCAG AA contrast ratio of 4.5:1 depending on amante-grey color definition.
**User Impact:** Users with low vision struggle to read helper text.
**Recommended Fix:** Test all grey text colors, ensure 4.5:1 minimum ratio, darken if needed.

### 42. Missing Hover States on Some Links
**Location:** Footer explore links, Contact page quick links
**Problem:** Some text links don't have visible hover state, users uncertain if clickable.
**User Impact:** Reduced affordance, users may not realize elements are interactive.
**Recommended Fix:** Ensure all links have underline on hover OR color change OR both.

### 43. Icon Sizes Inconsistent
**Location:** Throughout all pages
**Problem:** Icons vary between `w-4 h-4`, `w-5 h-5`, `w-6 h-6`, `w-8 h-8` with no clear pattern.
**User Impact:** Visual inconsistency, unprofessional appearance.
**Recommended Fix:** Define icon size scale: sm (16px), md (20px), lg (24px), xl (32px).

### 44. Form Section Headers Not Semantically Grouped
**Location:** All forms with multiple sections
**Problem:** Section headers like "Contact Information" use `<h3>` but aren't in `<fieldset>` with `<legend>`.
**User Impact:** Screen readers can't identify form sections properly, harder to navigate forms.
**Recommended Fix:** Wrap form sections in `<fieldset>` tags with `<legend>` for section titles.

### 45. Toast Notifications Position Not Consistent
**Location:** Using react-hot-toast but position not configured
**Problem:** Default toast position may overlap important UI elements.
**User Impact:** Users might miss important success/error messages.
**Recommended Fix:** Configure toast position explicitly:
```typescript
<Toaster position="top-center" />
```

### 46. Loading States Use Generic "Loading..." Text
**Location:** All button loading states
**Problem:** Loading text is generic "Submitting..." - doesn't confirm what's being submitted.
**User Impact:** Minor confusion, less reassuring feedback.
**Recommended Fix:** Use specific messages: "Sending reservation...", "Uploading resume...", etc.

### 47. Space Page Capacity Field Sometimes String, Sometimes Number Format
**Location:** SpacePageTemplate capacity prop
**Problem:** Inconsistent capacity representation: "50 guests", "Up to 100", "10-20 people".
**User Impact:** Users can't easily compare capacities across spaces.
**Recommended Fix:** Standardize format: "Capacity: 50 guests" or "Up to 50 guests".

### 48. No Print Styles
**Location:** Entire site
**Problem:** No print-specific CSS, pages won't print well (nav, footer, backgrounds waste ink).
**User Impact:** Users trying to print menus, event details, or reservation confirmations get poor results.
**Recommended Fix:** Add print media queries to hide nav/footer, adjust colors, optimize layout.

### 49. Focus Outline Color Low Contrast
**Location:** Default browser focus styles used throughout
**Problem:** Default blue focus outline may not be visible on all backgrounds (especially gradients).
**User Impact:** Keyboard users lose track of focused element.
**Recommended Fix:** Define custom focus styles with high-contrast outline:
```css
focus:outline-none focus:ring-2 focus:ring-amante-red focus:ring-offset-2 focus:ring-offset-white
```

### 50. Homepage Spaces Grid Not Responsive Enough
**Location:** `/src/components/HomePage.tsx` (line 288)
**Problem:** Grid uses `md:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-3` which on tablets shows 2 columns, leaving 6th card alone.
**User Impact:** Awkward layout on tablets, visual imbalance.
**Recommended Fix:** Use `sm:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-3` OR always use 2 columns on tablet sizes.

### 51. Footer Email Address Too Long
**Location:** Footer shows "contact.cafeamante@gmail.com"
**Problem:** Long email address breaks layout on small screens, looks unprofessional for brand.
**User Impact:** Minor visual issue, email doesn't match brand domain.
**Recommended Fix:** Use shorter branded email: hello@amante.in (as shown elsewhere in site).

### 52. Event Cards Line-Clamp May Cut Off Important Info
**Location:** `/src/app/events/page.tsx` (line 300) - `line-clamp-3`
**Problem:** Event descriptions truncated at 3 lines with no way to expand and read full description.
**User Impact:** Users miss important event details, can't make informed booking decision.
**Recommended Fix:** Add "Read more" button OR expand on hover/click OR link to dedicated event detail page.

### 53. Gallery Category Filter Doesn't Show Count
**Location:** `/src/app/gallery/page.tsx` filter buttons
**Problem:** Filter buttons don't show how many photos in each category.
**User Impact:** Users don't know if category has content before clicking.
**Recommended Fix:** Add count badge: "CafÃ© (4)", "Restaurant (4)", etc.

### 54. Success Modal Takes Over Entire Screen
**Location:** All form success states
**Problem:** Success modal is full viewport, removes all context about where user was.
**User Impact:** Disorienting, users don't know which form they just submitted.
**Recommended Fix:** Make success state an overlay modal OR keep minimal page context visible.

### 55. Career Application Resume File Size Limit Not Prominent
**Location:** `/src/app/careers/page.tsx`
**Problem:** 5MB file size limit only shown in small helper text after upload field.
**User Impact:** Users upload large files, see error, must compress and retry - frustrating.
**Recommended Fix:** Show file size limit in label: "Resume/CV (PDF/DOC, max 5MB)"

### 56. No Timezone Indication for Hours
**Location:** Footer and Contact page hours
**Problem:** Hours shown as "11:00 AM - 12:00 AM" with no timezone specified.
**User Impact:** Confusion for users from other timezones viewing site.
**Recommended Fix:** Add "(IST)" or timezone indicator to hours display.

### 57. Banquet Booking Page Missing
**Location:** Footer links to /banquet-booking
**Problem:** Based on file structure, banquet-booking page exists but wasn't reviewed. May have similar issues to other form pages.
**User Impact:** Unknown - page should be audited separately.
**Recommended Fix:** Conduct full audit of banquet-booking page using same criteria.

### 58. Animation Duration Inconsistencies
**Location:** Various pages using framer-motion
**Problem:** Animation durations vary: 0.5s, 0.6s, 0.8s, 1s with no clear pattern.
**User Impact:** Inconsistent feel across pages, some transitions feel slow, others rushed.
**Recommended Fix:** Standardize: fast (0.2s), normal (0.3s), slow (0.5s).
